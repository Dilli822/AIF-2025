It visits all the nodes at the level following the level of the source node. Then it visits all the nodes at the next level and so on.\n","\n","### **Working of BFS**\n","\n","Consider the following diagram:\n","<figure>\n","  <center>\n","    <img src='https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1z-cA2TUHQhRVWSbruiBEgylnr7R0NWPU'/>\n","    <figcaption>Figure 1: BFS</figcaption>\n","  </center>\n","</figure>\n","\n","The figure above shows a graph that consists of 9 nodes/vertices and 9 edges connecting those vertices. The figure also shows the flow of the graph traversal. Here we consider the node $A$ to be the starting node or source node so, it is the first node to be visited. In the case of BFS for the source node $A$ present at level 0, we need to move to level 1, which consists of three vertices $B$, $C$, and $D$. So, BFS visits vertex $B$ next, and at that level, it visits its neighbors first $C$ and then $D$. And now that we went through vertices at level 1, the BFS moves to level 2 nodes. Since vertex $B$ was the first node visited in level 1, its neighboring vertices $E$ and $F$ are visited first, followed by the vertices $G$ and $H$, neighbors of $C$, which was the second node visited in level 1. Finally, the neighbors of vertex $D$ is visited. So, this is how BFS traverses through the graph.\n","\n","### **Complexity**\n","The time complexity of BFS is $O(V + E)$, where $V$ is the number of nodes, and $E$ is the number of edges since. In the worst-case scenario, we visit every vertex and every edge.\n","\n","In the case of graphs that are too large to store explicitly, the complexity is described in different terms, mostly using $b$ and $d$, where $b$ is the branching factor of the graph, and $d$ is the depth of the node from the start or source node. So, to find a node at depth $d$ and $b$ being the branching factor of the graph, BFS takes $O(b^d)$ time and memory.\n","\n","### **Implementation**\n","For programming implementation, we can use a queue to store the nodes. The algorithm starts with the source node, enqueues it, and marks it as 'visited.' Then it deques the node and adds all neighboring. The queue follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) queuing method, and therefore, the node inserted first gets visited first, and so on.\n","\n","#### **Pseudocode**\n","**Input:** A graph G and starting source node (s)\\\n","**Output:** Goal state(g)\n","```\n","BFS (G, s, g)                   \n","      let Q be queue.\n","      //Insert s in queue\n","      Q.enqueue(s)\n","      \n","      mark s as visited\n","      while Q is not empty\n","           //Remove that vertex from queue to visit its neighbour\n","           v  =  Q.dequeue()\n","           if v is the Goal(g)\n","              return v\n","\n","          //visit all the neighboring nodes of v  \n","          for all neighbors w of v in Graph G\n","               if w is not visited\n","                        Q.enqueue( w )            \n","                        mark w as visited.\n","\n","```\n","\n","\n","\n","#### **Traversing process**\n","Let us use the graph above to see how the graph is traversed by using BFS.

Then, it visits the first neighbor of $A$, i.e., $B$ and then the first neighbor of $B$, i.e., $E$. Since $E$ has no neighbors, the algorithm traverses back to $B$ and visits its next neighbor $F$. And also, since $F$ doesn't have any neighbor, it traverses back to the node $A$, which still has unvisited neighbors, and then it visits $C$.
