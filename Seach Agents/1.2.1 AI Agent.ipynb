It is a composition of several interconnected components, each with a critical role to play:\n","\n","* Sensors: These act as the agent's windows to the world. Whether in the form of cameras, microphones, or other sensory devices, sensors capture raw data from the environment, serving as the agent's eyes and ears.\n","\n","* Perception Module: Raw sensory data alone isn't sufficient. The perception module steps in to make sense of this data. It transforms it into a comprehensible representation of the current environment, a crucial foundation for the agent's decision-making process.\n","\n","* Knowledge Base: Agents draw upon their accumulated knowledge about the world. This reservoir stores facts, rules, past experiences, and learned models. It is the context that guides the agent's choices and actions.\n","\n","* Decision-Making Component: Central to the agent's intelligence, this component processes information from the perception module and knowledge base to formulate decisions. These decisions can be based on rules, probabilities, or learned patterns from data.\n","\n","* Actuators: Agents interact with the environment through actuators, which are devices capable of executing actions. These can be as diverse as motors, speakers, displays, or any mechanism that allows the agent to affect its surroundings.\n","\n","* Execution Module: To translate decisions into real-world actions, agents rely on an execution module. This component ensures that the selected actions are executed effectively, bridging the gap between decision and impact.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"3GLu0hvHLPHz"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["<img src=\"\n","https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1xj7G21aCnhiVPpsfDxUIW-xLmIQ02m7L\" >Figure 2: Characteristics of an Agent"],"metadata":{"id":"qoAyP1B1vYlP"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Types of Agents:\n","\n","AI agents come in various forms, each tailored to specific tasks and scenarios:\n","\n","* Simple Reflex Agents: These agents operate on a \"current perception\" basis, making decisions based solely on the present moment.
